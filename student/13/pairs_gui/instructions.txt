Hello. This is the instruction for how to use this game.  First you have to enter the number of cards. It must be a even number.
Anything other than an even number will prompt error in game status area. Then you must enter two names, separated by a space, and
press enter. The name can be anything. Even if it's something like, XÃ†A-Xii, as long as it's one non-space word. There must be two
names. Else, the game will not start. Once you start the game, there will be a new dialog window. You have to press two cards and
then press next turn. If your turn resulted in a match, you will get points. All of that can be seen in the main window status
bar area. You will also be able to see who is in turn. You can also see which cards one has collected. If you feel like restarting
you are free to do so at any point in the game. Cards which has been played aka part of match, will be disabled.
Once all cards are played, it will be empty board, and you can't press next turn.
You can either restart the game or close the window or idk throw your computer out of the window. That is pretty much all you need
to know to play this game. This game also keeps track of time in second and updates it
as you change the turn and also at the end of the game. This game can also show you a
history of the previous game with each player name and their score. This area can get populated as you play the game.
Hope you enjoy it!
